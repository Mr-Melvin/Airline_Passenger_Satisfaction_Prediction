# Introduction
This project utilizes supervised learning techniques to develop a machine learning model for binary classification, predicting whether an airline passenger is satisfied or dissatisfied based on their feedback and flight experience data. 
Leveraging the power of machine learning, this project aims to analyze key factors influencing passenger satisfaction and provide accurate predictions. 
The model is deployed using Streamlit, a Python framework, to develop a user-friendly frontend and backend interface, enabling intuitive interaction and visualization of results.
